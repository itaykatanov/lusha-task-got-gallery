# Game Of Thrones Cards Gallery App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with typescript template.


## Assumptions
* The API responses quickly with a handful of items so no pagination is needed.
* Items from API are unique and do not need to be filtered or validated.

## Available Scripts

After running `npm install`, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
